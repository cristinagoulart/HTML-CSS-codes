This project is a little modification from the high fives game. 


I used just css (using Sass - Koala wich is super easy to install) to made the animation and i made it following the tutorial from the awesome Una Kravets in CSSconfEU2017.


The original game is very beautiful, but my choice was made it simple because was the first time i seen pixels! 

The result was super simple and not that beautiful but its great and i had tons of fun!!
